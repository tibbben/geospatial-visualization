### Course Description:  

This course introduces the student to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and how to apply GIS technologies in sustainable and resilient urban planning and architectural design contexts. Three principal activities will be emphasized: how to find, access, and use pre-existing GIS datasets; how to use industry standard tools such as ArcGIS and QGIS to perform basic analysis of geospatial data; and how to use ArcGIS and QGIS to transform and export geospatial data for use with applications such as Illustrator and AutoCAD. A series of hands on lab based exercises will build student GIS skill sets and encourage students to produce materials applicable to real-world projects for their respective research projects or design studios. The one credit option is designed to provide a basic introduction to geographic information systems, to foster spatial literacy, and to generate skills that will enable students to engage in geospatial storytelling and advanced cartographic projects. The three credit option introduces tools to enable students in more advanced geospatial data analysis and visualization with a focus on sustainable and resilient urban design and planning.

### Texts and Materials: 

*Books:*  

-   Krygier, J. & Wood, D. (2016). *Making Maps: A visual Guide to Map Design for GIS (Third ed.)*. New York: The Guilford Press.  
-   Field, K. (2018). *Cartography. The Definitive Guide to Making Maps*. Redlands, ESRI Press.  

The course will use selected materials from both of the above books. The Krygier and Wood book is a great set of 'how to' materials. The Field book is a beautiful reference for all things cartography. Students are not required to purchase the two books, but acquiring your own copy is highly recommended and will make valuable additions to any personal library. Alternatively the Krygier and Wood book is available as en eBook through the library website and the instructors will provide limited access to the Field book as needed for assignments.

*Other Readings:*  

Optional reading materials will be available through online access or directly from the instructors. Please see the box folder and/or the course schedule for the links (both below).

### Assignments:  

With the exception of the first meeting, there will be assignments for each meeting throughout the entire course. These assignments will include reading with short written summaries, practical computer work, preparation for in class presentations, and cartography/GIS assignments. All assignments made will be due in the following class meeting as per the weekly schedule.  

While the class schedule in this syllabus (below) contains guidelines for the assignments, final expectations for the individual assignments will be set during class. The instructors reserve the right to make reasonable changes to the assignments in the course schedule below.

---

### Midterm Examination:  

There will be a written midterm exam given during the week of October 9th. The exam will consist of multiple choice and short answer questions based on lecture slides and required readings.

---

### Class Participation:  

Engagement in class activities through speaking, assigned in-class presentations, and participating in thoughtful, engaged and positive criticism of instructor and student work is very important and will be evaluated for each class meeting.  

[//]: # (As a part of class participation in the Zoom meetings you may be asked to share your screen; you are expected to be prepared to share your screen at a moments notice.)

---

### Class Project:  

As a class project, each student will create at least one map layout and present it through a medium of their choice (print, projected, online, or another). All projects must be discussed and approved with one of the instructors prior to presentation. There will be three stages of presentation for this project, an initial sketch due in the fifth week, then a review presentation given during the last two of the course, and a polished presentation given during the final exam period. All students enrolled in the full three credit course must choose a class project that is within the context of urban sustainability and/or resilience. NOTE: screenshots of maps and/or map images from other publications are not acceptable in any stage of these presentations; the maps presented must be your own work and must be exported from the GIS software of choice for use in the presentations.

[//]: # (upload project folder to box)

> __Initial Sketch__ (due in week 5):

The map must have at least two layers of data displayed in a simple overlay analysis (the two layers are not background or base map layers) and there must be an aggregated data set either displayed as geographic information on the map image itself or as a summary table included in the map layout. The map layout must tell a story: this means the layout may use elements such as a title, legend, labels, geographic features, scale, descriptive text, context, locator map, insets, credits, and sources with integrity in a harmonious and holistic presentation to make a spatial argument or to present a spatial vision of past, present or future. The initial sketch of the class project will be due in the week five meeting with a brief presentation (no longer than five minutes)for a critical review by fellow students and instructors. All students enrolled in the full three credit course must also propose an urban sustainability/resilience research question that the project will seek to answer.

> __Review Presentation__ (due in weeks 14 and 15):

[//]: # (needs reconsideration for full semester course, could be in pairs? How many students should we expect?)

The map(s) for the final class project must meet all the same requirements as the initial sketch. Additionally, more than one map may be presented, at least five data layers must be put into a conversation for the story to be told, and the map(s) should be an integral part of a GIS-based analysis that seeks to answer the proposed urban sustainability and/or resilience research question. All final projects must be discussed and approved by one of the instructors. Additionally the map must be put into context with a 400-500 word written statement that accompanies the map(s). The written statement can form part of the map layout or can be a separate document. The statement will augment the story that the map (or maps) tell and will have a bibliography that lists references and all data sources used for the project (bibliography and sources not included in word count). The statement can be thought of as a five paragraph essay that touches on: 1) an introduction to the research question, 2) a discussion of data sources, 3) a summary of methods used for data transformations 4) a narrative of the story or findings, and 5) an assessment of strengths and weaknesses in the story/findings. Each final project will be presented for review in the final two course meetings; students will be prepared to give a 10-15 minute presentation about their work followed by a critique from fellow students and instructors. The presentation must include:

[//]: # (do we still want to critique SOA style??)

-   An outline of the story that the map(s) tell
-   A discussion of data sources
-   A discussion of data transformation
-   A discussion of software applications used
-   A discussion of design choices for the map(s)
-   A discussion of the findings to the proposed urban sustainability/resilience research question  
-   A self-critique of the cartographic processes with attention give to strengths and weaknesses  

[//]: # (focus more on answer or on story >> is the course to prepare students for the political realities of sustainability/resilience or simply be a researcher in this field?)

[//]: # (two sets of criteria, one for architects and one for urban design/geography)

> __Final Presentation__ (due during final exam - December 8th at 5:00 pm):  

Students will have 10 minutes (strict: 5 minutes for presentation, 5 minutes for q/a) to give a formal presentation of their class project. This is to be considered as a business presentation to clients.
