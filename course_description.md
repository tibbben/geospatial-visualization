###Course Description:  

This course introduces the student to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and how to apply GIS technologies in architectural design and urban planning contexts. Three principal activities will be emphasized: how to find, access, and use pre-existing GIS datasets; how to use industry standard tools such as ArcGIS and QGIS to perform basic analysis of geospatial data; and how to use ArcGIS and QGIS to transform and export geospatial data for use with applications such as Illustrator, AutoCAD and Rino. A series of hands on lab based exercises will build student GIS skill sets and encourage students to produce materials applicable to real-world projects in their respective design studios. The class is designed to provide a basic introduction to geographic information systems, to foster spatial literacy, and to generate skills that will enable students to engage in geospatial storytelling and advanced cartographic projects.  

In these unusual and extra-ordinary times we are making every effort to provide instruction at the same level as it would be if everyone were able to attend class in person, use university resources without restriction, and have access to all printed library materials without restriction. To provide the best learning experience will take collective effort and flexibility from all of us, and we welcome your input into how the class is (and is not) working as the semester unfolds. Please be aware that if, at any time, we determine that conditions are unsafe and/or pedagogically untenable, then *we reserve the right to change how we are operating (in both format and content), in order to promote the safest and most rewarding intellectual experience under the current conditions.*

###Texts and Materials: 

*Books:*  

-   Krygier, J. & Wood, D. (2016). *Making Maps: A visual Guide to Map Design for GIS (Third ed.)*. New York: The Guilford Press.  
-   Field, K. (2018). *Cartography. The Definitive Guide to Making Maps*. Redlands, ESRI Press.  

The course will use selected materials from both of the above books. The Krygier and Wood book is a great set of 'how to' materials. The Field book is a beautiful reference for all things cartography. Students are not required to purchase the two books, but aquiring your own copy is highly recommended and will make valuable additions to any personal library. Alternatively the Krygier and Wood book is available as en eBook through the library website and the instructors will provide limited access to the Field book as needed for assignments.

*Other Readings:*  

Optional reading materials will be available through online access or directly from the instructors. Please see the box folder and/or the course schedule for the links (both below).

*Geospatial Data:*  

Students are required to download and transform geospatial data for projects throughout the course and for the final project. Guidance will be given on how to do this.

*Shared Teams Folder*  

A shared Microsoft teams folder for readings and geospatial data is located at [https://bit.ly/3dvRCC6](https://bit.ly/3dvRCC6){:target="\_blank"}

*Presentation Schedule*  

An on line docx file (PresentationsTopics.docx) for tracking the in class presentations from Field (2018) is in the shared teams folder mentioned above and can be accessed directly at: [https://bit.ly/2B2k9lC](https://bit.ly/2B2k9lC){:target="\_blank"}

###Computers and Software:  

Students are required to bring a functioning computer to every class meeting (Mac, PC, or Linux).  

Throughout the course students will use several software tools that are proprietary (license provided by the University of Miami) and open-source (no license fee). With the exception of ArcGIS, any the software listed will run on any operating system (Mac, PC, or Linux). Guidance will be provided on how to choose the correct project specific software and how to install and configure a working environment on a computer.

###Methods of Instruction:  

Lecture-discussion, demonstration, and practical out-of-class and
in-class assignments. Students are expected to participate in the
lectures, discussions, and in-class projects. We expect that students
have little or no prior GIS/cartography experience/training.

---

###Evaluation of Student Performance: 

Students will be assigned a letter grade (A-F) based on the following:

| Evaluated work | percentage / points |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Assignments | 30% / 30 pts |  
| Class Participation | 30% / 30 pts |  
| Class Project | 40% / 40 pts |  
| Total | 100% / 100 pts |  

###Assignments:  

With the exception of the first meeting, there will be assignments for each meeting throughout 
the five week course. These assignments will include reading, practical computer work, preparation 
for in class presentations, and cartography/GIS assignments. All assignments made will be due in the 
following class meeting as per the weekly schedule.  

While the class schedule in this syllabus (below) contains guidelines for the assignments, final expectations for the individual assignments will be set during class.

---

###Class Participation:  

Engagement in class activities through speaking, assigned in-class presentations, and participating in 
thoughtful, engaged and positive criticism of instructor and student work is very important and will 
be evaluated for each class meeting.

---

###Class Project:  

As a class project, each student will create one map layout and present it through a medium of their choice (print, projected, online, or another). The map image must have at least two layers of data displayed in a simple overlay analysis (this does not include background or base map layers) and there must be an aggregated data set either displayed as geographic information on the map image itself or as a summary table included in the map layout. The map layout must tell a story: this means the layout may use elements such as a title, legend, labels, geographic features, scale, descriptive text, context, locater map, insets, credits, and sources with integrity in a harmonious and holistic presentation to make a spatial argument or to present a spatial vision of past, present or future. The class project will be presented in the final meeting for a critical review by fellow students and instructors.
