###Course Description:  

This course introduces the student to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and how to apply GIS technologies in architectural design and urban planning contexts. Three principal activities will be emphasized: how to find, access, and use pre-existing GIS datasets; how to use industry standard tools such as ArcGIS and QGIS to perform basic analysis of geospatial data; and how to use ArcGIS and QGIS to transform and export geospatial data for use with applications such as Illustrator, AutoCAD and Rino. A series of hands on lab based exercises will build student GIS skill sets and encourage students to produce materials applicable to real-world projects in their respective design studios. The class is designed to provide a basic introduction to geographic information systems, to foster spatial literacy, and to generate skills that will enable students to engage in geospatial storytelling and advanced cartographic projects.

###Texts and Materials: 

*Books:*  

-   Krygier, J. & Wood, D. (2016). *Making Maps: A visual Guide to Map Design for GIS (Third ed.)*. New York: The Guilford Press.  
-   Field, K. (2018). *Cartography. The Definitive Guide to Making Maps*. ESRI Press.  

The course will use limited materials from both of the above books. Students are not required to purchase the two books as they both will be available in the Architecture Library as Course Reserve Material. 

*Other Readings:*  

Optional reading materials will be available through online access or directly from the instructors. Please see the course schedule below for the links.

*Geospatial Data:*  

Students are required to download and transform geospatial data for projects throughout the course and for the final project. Guidance will be given on how to do this.

###Computers and Software:  

Students are required to bring a functioning computer to every class meeting (Mac, PC, or Linux).  

Throughout the course students will use several software tools that are proprietary (license provided by the University of Miami) and open-source (no license fee). With the exception of ArcGIS, any the software listed will run on any operating system (Mac, PC, or Linux). Guidance will be provided on how to choose the correct project specific software and how to install and configure a working environment on a computer.  

*Proprietary (get through UMIT)*  

-   the ESRI ArcGIS suite of mapping tools (PC only):
  -   [http://www.esri.com/](http://www.esri.com/arcgis/about-arcgis)
  -   [UMIT ArcGIS](https://www.it.miami.edu/a-z-listing/arcgis/index.html)  
-   the Adobe Creative Clound suite of design tools:

  -   [UMIT Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.it.miami.edu/a-z-listing/adobe-creative-cloud/index.html)  

*Open-Source*  

-   QGIS [https://www.qgis.org/](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)  
-   PostgreSQL [https://www.postgresql.org/](https://www.postgresql.org)

###Practical Course Output/Activities

1.  Identify, download, install and configure appropriate software tools to construct a Geographic Information System (GIS)  
2.  Find, download, transform and organize geospatial data for use in the GIS  
3.  Construct a GIS using a combination of the above software and data  
4.  Export intermediate cartographic products from the GIS and import said products into design applications  
5.  Prepare output ready cartographic products in design applications

###Methods of Instruction:  

Lecture-discussion, demonstration, and practical out-of-class and
in-class assignments. Students are expected to participate in the
lectures, discussions, and in-class projects. We expect that students
have little or no prior GIS/cartography experience/training.

###Evaluation of Student Performance: 

Students will be assigned a letter grade (A-F) based on the following:

| Evaluated work | percentage / points |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Assignments | 30% / 30 pts |  
| Class Participation | 30% / 30 pts |  
| Final Project | 40% / 40 pts |  
| Total | 100% / 100 pts |  

###Assignments:  

With the exception of the first meeting, there will be assignments for each meeting throughout 
the five week course. These assignments will include reading, practical computer work, preparation 
for in class presentations, and cartography/GIS assignments. All assignments made will be due in the 
following class meeting as per the weekly schedule.

---

###Class Participation:  

Engagement in class activities through speaking, assigned in-class presentations, and participating in 
thoughtful, engaged and positive criticism of instructor and student work is very important and will 
be evaluated for each class meeting.

---

###Final Project:  

As a final project, students will create one map and present it through a medium of their choice (print, projected, online, or another). The map must have at least two layers of data displayed in a simple overlay analysis (this does not include background or base map layers). The map must tell a story: this means the map may use elements such as a title, legend, labels, geographic features, scale, descriptive text, context, locater map, insets, credits, and sources with integrity in a harmonious and holistic presentation to make a spatial argument or to present a spatial vision of past, present or future. The final project will be presented in the final class meeting for a critical review by fellow students and instructors.

###Code of Conduct:  

-   Cell Phones: All phones should be on silent mode. Responses to calls or SMS/texts are only appropriate in emergency situations.  

-   Talking: Talking is appropriate and encouraged when the student is recognized by the entire class as the speaker or during in class group assignments. Otherwise no talking is allowed between students.  

-   Safe Space: All opinions will be respected, diversity of thought encouraged, and positive criticism cultivated. If students feel that the classroom is not a safe space or that there is a policy violation in the classroom, please talk to the instructor or seek help through these UM resources:
  -   If your report concern addresses an immediate threat of harm to a student or the university community, please call the University of Miami Police Department at (305) 284-6666 or dial 911.
