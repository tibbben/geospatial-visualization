##SOA <number> - [Urban Cartography (4 credits)](https://github.com/tibbben/urban-cartography)  

**Instructors**:  
Dr. Timothy Norris – Visiting Librarian Assistant Professor, Richter Library/Center for Computational Science  
Christopher Mader - Director of Software Engineering - Center for Computational Science

**Meetings:** TBD

**Course Description:**  
This course is an introduction to cartography and geographic information systems (GIS) in the context of urban design. It will provide students with the knowledge and practical experience necessary to create simple cartographic representations of physical and social phenomena on the earth’s surface (maps). The course begins with theoretical and conceptual discussion about the organization and analysis of spatial data and information. The course will rely on data from public (open government) as well as private sources. Practical exercises based on student work and an ongoing participatory mapping and urban design project in Barranquilla Colombia will accompany the theoretical material. The practical exercises will use several different digital tools including the ESRI ArcGIS suite of applications, the Adobe suite of design products, and the open source tools such as QGIS. The class is designed to provide a basic introduction to geographic information systems, to foster spatial literacy, and to generate skills that will enable students to engage in geospatial storytelling and advanced cartographic projects.
