**Course Description:**  
This course introduces the student to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and how to apply GIS technologies in architectural design and urban planning contexts. Three principal activities will be emphasized: how to find, access, and use pre-existing GIS datasets; how to use industry standard tools such as ArcGIS and QGIS to perform basic analysis of geospatial data; and how to use ArcGIS and QGIS to transform and export geospatial data for use with applications such as Illustrator, AutoCAD and Rino. A series of hands on lab based exercises will build student GIS skill sets and encourage students to produce materials applicable to real-world projects in their respective design studios. The class is designed to provide a basic introduction to geographic information systems, to foster spatial literacy, and to generate skills that will enable students to engage in geospatial storytelling and advanced cartographic projects.

**Texts and Materials:**  
-   Krygier, J. & Wood, D. (2016). Making Maps: A visual Guide to Map Design for GIS (Third ed.). New York: The Guilford Press.  
-   Field, K. (2018). Cartography. The Definitive Guide to Making Maps. ESRI Press.  

The course will use limited materials from both of the above books. You are not required to purchase the two books as they both will be available in the Architecture Library as Course Reserve Material.

**Software:**  
We will use several software tools that are proprietary (license provided by the University of Miami) and open-source (no license fee) 

Proprietary (get through UMIT)  
-   the ESRI ArcGIS suite of mapping tools: [http://www.esri.com/](http://www.esri.com/arcgis/about-arcgis)  
-   the Adobe Creative Clound suite of design tools: [https://www.adobe.com/](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html)  

Open-Source  
-   QGIS [https://www.qgis.org/](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)  
-   PostgreSQL [https://www.postgresql.org/](https://www.postgresql.org)  

**Prerequisites:**   
None  

**Measureable Learning Outcomes:**  

1.  Identify, download, install and configure appropriate software tools to construct a Geographic Information System (GIS)  
2.  Find, download, transform and organize geospatial data for use in the GIS  
3.  Construct a GIS using a combination of the above software and data  
4.  Export intermediate cartographic products from the GIS and import said products into design applications  
5.  Prepare output ready cartographic products in design applications
