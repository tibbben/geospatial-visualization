###Class Attendance and Absences  

Regular and punctual class attendance is mandatory for all architecture courses; three unexcused absences constitutes grounds for dismissal from the course and/or a failing grade. Students are required to be present for an entire design review, therefore, students arriving late or departing early from class will be considered absent. Excused absences require written notification and are granted by the instructor.  

It is each student’s responsibility to know and understand the instructor’s policies. It is also the student’s responsibility to give the instructor notice one week prior to any anticipated absence and to contact the instructor within one week after any unanticipated absence.  

All students are responsible for material covered during their absence. However, the instructor must allow each student who is absent for a University approved reason either the opportunity to make up, or to be excused from, work missed, without any reduction in the student’s final course grade as a direct result of such absence.  

Other than absences for a University-approved reason, the instructor determines whether or not an absence is for an acceptable reason and whether or not students shall have the opportunity to make up missed work. If the instructor does not recognize the reason as acceptable, the student may appeal to the chair of the department.  

*UNIVERSITY-APPROVED REASONS FOR ABSENCES*  

1. Participation in an activity approved by the Academic Deans Policy Council, such as musical and debate activity, R.O.T.C. function, or varsity athletic trip; participation in a special academic activity such as a field trip or other special event connected with academic coursework. Verification of a student’s participation shall be issued by the sponsor when authorized by the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost.  
2. Observance of a religious holy day as described in the Religious Holy Day Policy, below:

*RELIGIOUS HOLY DAY POLICY*  

The University of Miami, although a secular institution, is determined to accommodate those students who wish to observe religious holy days. It seeks to reflect its awareness of and sensitivity to religious holy days whenever possible when scheduling University activities. The following provisions are meant to apply equitably to all religious groups and to provide opportunities to all to meet their religious obligations.  

1. Except as specifically provided to the contrary, this policy is binding on all students in undergraduate programs. Schools offering graduate or professional programs, including undergraduate professional programs, are strongly encouraged to adhere to these policies to the maximum extent practicable.  
2. Any student absent from class in observance of a religious holy day shall not be penalized in any way for an examination or assignment missed during the period of absence. Absence in observance of a religious holy day does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence. Students who are absent on days of examinations or class assignments shall be offered a reasonable opportunity to make up the work without penalty, if the student previously arranged to be absent. Nothing in this policy shall preclude faculty members from limiting the number of student absences to a reasonable number of absences for any reason. The faculty member has discretion to determine how the make-up obligation will be fulfilled. A faculty member who penalizes a student contrary to these provisions may have committed unprofessional conduct, and thus may be subject to a complaint to the Committee on Professional Conduct under the provisions of Section B4.9 of the Faculty Manual.  
3. It is the student’s obligation to provide faculty members with notice of the dates they will be absent due to observance of religious holy days, preferably before the beginning of classes but no later than the end of the first three class days. For religious holy days that fall within the first three class days, students must provide faculty members with notice no later than two class days before the absence. Missing a class due to travel plans associated with a particular religious holy day does not constitute an excused absence. Absences due to observance of religious holy days that are not pre-arranged with the relevant faculty member within the first three class days may be considered unexcused, and the faculty member may therefore prevent the student from making up examinations or assignments missed during the period of absence.  
4. Faculty members are encouraged to anticipate days when a substantial number of students will be absent for observance of religious holy days and should avoid scheduling examinations and assignment deadlines on those days. Faculty members are expected to reasonably assist students in obtaining class information the student missed during the period of absence in observance of a religious holy day. In that regard, faculty members are urged to allow taping or recording of the class session, with the reproduction limited to the student’s personal use, when a student misses a class due to observance of a religious holy day. To assist in identifying religious observance days, faculty members are encouraged to consult the illustrative list provided in the Interfaith Calendar (http://www.interfaithcalendar.org). Faculty members are urged to remind students of their obligation to inform faculty members within the first three class days of any anticipated absences due to observance of religious holy days and should include that information in the syllabus or course requirements document for that course.

###School Culture Policy

*introduction*  

The University of Miami establishes certain policies – some, which have to do with the preservation of academic integrity such as the Honor Code, and others, which preserve a climate of freedom from harassment – in order to best support the environment necessary to the pursuit of knowledge. Each School or college produces additional policies that focus on the special needs and conditions of its constituency.  

Following is a brief outline of the operating instructions for the use of classroom space in the School of Architecture.  These policies are the result of an ongoing consideration for the minimal standards necessary to support a constructive working environment.  The ideal classroom goes much further to establish a place of inspiration and collegiality.  The minimum policies contained here apply to every classroom and studio space. An individual studio or classroom may have additional policies or enhancements as set by the instructor.
Regarding this most general outline, each student and member of the faculty is considered to be bound to uphold this standard, through personnel performance as well as in concert with others, as in the upholding of the Honor Code.  Students who repeat a violation after a warning will be asked to vacate their desk and leave the studio or classroom.  The desk and its incumbent participation in the life of the studio or classroom is a central benefit to an architect’s education and each student is an important participant in the overall effort to create an environment of intellectual productivity.

*STUDENTS:*  

*desks and drawing equipment*  

Your desk, the walls and immediate space it occupies, are a public, academic space and should be treated accordingly. All materials in the work area, from those pinned on the walls to items around the desk, should relate solely to the academic investigations of the curriculum. Desks must be kept neat and orderly at all times.  Drawing surfaces are to be clean, uniform and ready for design, drawing work and desk crits. Drawing equipment shall be in good working order at all times, and storable equipment shall be properly secured when not in use.  Borrowing of equipment during class time is not allowed. Student’s belongings should be marked or engraved to identify its owner. Any theft should be reported to campus security immediately. All students are to have the necessary tools to work at all times. Do not introduce any article larger than a drawing tool into the studio.  The student lounge provides space for a limited number of additional items in support of academic work.

*disposition of your work*  

Care of drawings and models through proper storage on or in desks is required at all times. Drawings or model materials left on the floor may be removed by Janitors.  Do not leave work or store work on the floor since Janitors will not be able to distinguish between what should be saved or discarded.  Throw trash in receptacles rather than on the floor.  To ensure the studio remains a safe place to work never prop open doors.  All students registered for design studios will have card access.

*disposition of others work*  

Show respect for other students work and space by asking permission to use a desk other than your own. Do not use another student’s desk for model building.

*studio behavior*  

Behavior in studio should be the model of respectful collaboration providing each student and faculty the possibility of a quiet and productive work environment.  Cell phones, pagers, or music are not to be heard in class at all.  Headphones may be used during non-class time hours provided the volume does not disturb those working around you. Outside of class, use the courtyard for more animated conversation or exchange, talking on cell- phones, eating, drinking, or group study. Remember it is each student’s right to have a quiet and respectful studio workspace. Smoking is prohibited on all University of Miami campuses.  

*plotting drawings*  

Plotting should be done well in advance of routine desk crits or presentations. In professional practice, private clients, review boards, competition officials and permitting authorities do not wait for work that is late.  It is therefore unacceptable for faculty or classmates to have to wait for students who are late to class, a pin-up, mid-term review or final presentation due to last minute plotting. Leaving studio to plot is also not acceptable because it prevents faculty from addressing the whole class when needed.  Students are to be present for the entire class and not arrive late or leave early. The proper budgeting of time for plotting of drawings is essential. Faculty must adhere to scheduled review dates in order to not overload the lab when it comes to plotting time. Students must adhere to lab rules with regard to computer use for rendering and plotting time so as to not tie up computers in the lab or 3rd floor classroom.  The computers are for the use of all students and assigned time must be adhered to. 

Plotting early allows students time to review the quality of the output, make the necessary changes, and re-plot before presenting the work. Problems in plotting or mistakes in output are your mistakes and can not be blamed on hardware, software or printing services- they are yours alone and you need to allow time for unforeseen problems so work presented is without excuse and free of mistakes. Checking work is a fundamental skill of the architect and reviewing drawings for consistency, clarity, and completeness is essential.
Please consult the Computer Lab policies for additional information.

*making models*  

The production of studio models is a collective effort requiring shared responsibilities and shared costs. Each studio will have a small budget each semester for the production of studio models to help defray costs. Faculty must inform the Model Shop director, well in advance, of any assigned models that would involve students working in the shop. Spraying of models must be done outside the studio on paper surfaces to catch overspray.  Do not use exterior bare concrete landings or floors without protecting the surface with paper. Please also check Model Shop policies.

*submission of work* 

All stuent work should be due no later than the night before the work is due. Faculty teaching in the core studios must coordinate the collection of work to insure parity with each studio. 

*reviews*  

Reviews are one of the most important learning experiences in the school. Attendance and participation in all assigned reviews are required. Attending the reviews of your peers allows you to see the range of architectural criticism born by different studio topics, sites and the interests and expertise of professors and visiting critics. Attending the reviews of others within your year is often helpful in better understanding your project. Attending the work in other studios broadens your academic experience and helps you prepare for future classes. Student deportment in reviews should model professional standards one finds in practice - dress for should be more formal then everyday attire.  

Core studio coordinators must ensure that there is parity among different sections in presentation requirements, schedule, and participation. Each studio must have coordinated presentation requirements and grading of work.

*student interaction*  

The school and university is a collaborative environment where ideas can be discussed in a respectful and collegial manner. Students shall understand that the school is an academic community that aspires to the highest ethical standards. Differences of opinion should be respected and students should avoid consciously undermining another student’s work or ideas.  

*Peer counselors:* Are selected student representation for each section of first year studio. These students assist in providing guidance for students adjusting to life in the university and professional program.

*FACULTY:*  

*studio teaching ethics*  

The Design Studio is the centerpiece of architectural education and the vehicle from which to impart the Schools’ pedagogy: that architecture is a civic art. School conduct must therefore be of the highest ethical standard and the professor must be held as a model of such behavior. Because teaching both emulates and critiques the practice of architecture, the professor must make the similarities and distinctions between the academic and professional spheres clear.  

Studios may engage in real projects, but only for the academic benefits of such engagement to both the student and the community. At no time is a student’s work to be used privately for a professor’s professional or financial gain. If a professor is engaged in professional practice no current project should be issued as a design studio assignment. If a professor is entering a design competition as a studio project, all issues of authorship and intellectual property, should be handled generously, professionally and in keeping with all University policies regarding such matters. These issues should be worked out in advance with the Dean’s office. If the competition includes prize monies or the granting of a commission these conditions should also be worked out in advance with the Dean’s office.  

Throughout the school where quasi- professional work is often the form of community assistance, special care should be taken to ensure clarity of purpose for the exercise and associated costs and fees; this information needs to be communicated broadly with each engagement. It is important that local, regional, and national architect understand that these centers do not compete with architectural forms. These centers provide a unique community service complementing traditional practice and providing access to diriment branches of our community often without recourse to design assistance.  

In short, a professor’s engagement in design studio teaching should be selfless pursuit imparting knowledge of architecture and searching collectively for new and time honored ways in which design improves the quality of life, protects the settings where life unfolds and stimulates the universal human desire for beauty.

*faculty / student interaction*  

Faculty should remember that this is not seen as equal pairing. Given that faculty are issuing grades students will see faculty as an authority figure. Use good judgment in deciding when, where and how to talk to a student about a sensitive issue. Do not be confrontational. If you are a faculty teaching for the first time or teaching a new course or new format for the first time remember to consult studio coordinators, more senior faculty or advising staff with problems that require more input or information before meeting with the student. Always be impeccable in your word.  

Faculty must start and finish class at the scheduled times.  his allows students to get to their other classes on time.  

All Faculty are expected to keep office hours of a minimum of one hour per week and to post hours outside their offices. Office hours can be fixed or by appointment but must be published. Faculty are encouraged to list office hours in their course syllabi. Additional time for preparation of a course, grading, advising and studio coordination meetings is expected to occur outside of class time.

*faculty/faculty interaction*  

Faculty should understand that the school and university is an environment where ideas can be discussed in a respectful and collegial manner. Differences of opinion should be respected and faculty should avoid consciously undermining another faculty, the school, or the university. 

*faculty coordinator/core faculty interaction*  

Coordinators are to work with faculty in parallel courses across the semester to coordinate deadlines and course content. In design studio, they must be responsive to student concerns across the different sections, and must provide guidance or intervene on faculty matters outside their individual studio section. 

*faculty / staff interaction*  

Faculty must understand that staff is assigned work by other faculty, administration and university departments. Do not leave important tasks to the last minute. Organization and forethought will help create an atmosphere of respect and ensure requested tasks of staff will be completed in a timely manner. Staff should not be asked to perform duties of a personal (non-school related) nature, nor request that staff utilize university equipment of supplies for personal matters.

###Plagiarism and Misconduct - the UM Honor Code:  

The University’s policy on academic misconduct is contained in the University of Miami Honor Code.  

These Codes are established for the student body to protect the academic integrity of the University of Miami, to encourage consistent ethical behavior among students, and to foster a climate of fair competition. While a student's commitment to honesty and personal integrity is assumed and expected, these Codes are intended to provide an added measure of assurance that, in fulfilling the University's requirements, the student will never engage in falsification, plagiarism, or other deception regarding the materials he/she presents. Each student is responsible for completing the academic requirements of each course in the manner indicated by the faculty. Please see the appropriate link below.
