###Class Attendance and Absences  

Regular and punctual class attendance is mandatory for all architecture courses; three unexcused absences constitutes grounds for dismissal from the course and/or a failing grade. Students are required to be present for an entire design review, therefore, students arriving late or departing early from class will be considered absent. Excused absences require written notification and are granted by the instructor.  

It is each student’s responsibility to know and understand the instructor’s policies. It is also the student’s responsibility to give the instructor notice one week prior to any anticipated absence and to contact the instructor within one week after any unanticipated absence.  

All students are responsible for material covered during their absence. However, the instructor must allow each student who is absent for a University approved reason either the opportunity to make up, or to be excused from, work missed, without any reduction in the student’s final course grade as a direct result of such absence.  

Other than absences for a University-approved reason, the instructor determines whether or not an absence is for an acceptable reason and whether or not students shall have the opportunity to make up missed work. If the instructor does not recognize the reason as acceptable, the student may appeal to the chair of the department.  

*UNIVERSITY-APPROVED REASONS FOR ABSENCES*  

1. Participation in an activity approved by the Academic Deans Policy Council, such as musical and debate activity, R.O.T.C. function, or varsity athletic trip; participation in a special academic activity such as a field trip or other special event connected with academic coursework. Verification of a student’s participation shall be issued by the sponsor when authorized by the Office of the Executive Vice President and Provost.  
2. Observance of a religious holy day as described in the Religious Holy Day Policy, below:

*RELIGIOUS HOLY DAY POLICY*  

The University of Miami, although a secular institution, is determined to accommodate those students who wish to observe religious holy days. It seeks to reflect its awareness of and sensitivity to religious holy days whenever possible when scheduling University activities. The following provisions are meant to apply equitably to all religious groups and to provide opportunities to all to meet their religious obligations.  

1. Except as specifically provided to the contrary, this policy is binding on all students in undergraduate programs. Schools offering graduate or professional programs, including undergraduate professional programs, are strongly encouraged to adhere to these policies to the maximum extent practicable.  
2. Any student absent from class in observance of a religious holy day shall not be penalized in any way for an examination or assignment missed during the period of absence. Absence in observance of a religious holy day does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence. Students who are absent on days of examinations or class assignments shall be offered a reasonable opportunity to make up the work without penalty, if the student previously arranged to be absent. Nothing in this policy shall preclude faculty members from limiting the number of student absences to a reasonable number of absences for any reason. The faculty member has discretion to determine how the make-up obligation will be fulfilled. A faculty member who penalizes a student contrary to these provisions may have committed unprofessional conduct, and thus may be subject to a complaint to the Committee on Professional Conduct under the provisions of Section B4.9 of the Faculty Manual.  
3. It is the student’s obligation to provide faculty members with notice of the dates they will be absent due to observance of religious holy days, preferably before the beginning of classes but no later than the end of the first three class days. For religious holy days that fall within the first three class days, students must provide faculty members with notice no later than two class days before the absence. Missing a class due to travel plans associated with a particular religious holy day does not constitute an excused absence. Absences due to observance of religious holy days that are not pre-arranged with the relevant faculty member within the first three class days may be considered unexcused, and the faculty member may therefore prevent the student from making up examinations or assignments missed during the period of absence.  
4. Faculty members are encouraged to anticipate days when a substantial number of students will be absent for observance of religious holy days and should avoid scheduling examinations and assignment deadlines on those days. Faculty members are expected to reasonably assist students in obtaining class information the student missed during the period of absence in observance of a religious holy day. In that regard, faculty members are urged to allow taping or recording of the class session, with the reproduction limited to the student’s personal use, when a student misses a class due to observance of a religious holy day. To assist in identifying religious observance days, faculty members are encouraged to consult the illustrative list provided in the Interfaith Calendar (http://www.interfaithcalendar.org). Faculty members are urged to remind students of their obligation to inform faculty members within the first three class days of any anticipated absences due to observance of religious holy days and should include that information in the syllabus or course requirements document for that course.

###School of Architecture Culture Policy

*introduction*  

The University of Miami establishes certain policies – some, which have to do with the preservation of academic integrity such as the Honor Code (below), and others, which preserve a climate of freedom from harassment (above) – in order to best support the environment necessary to the pursuit of knowledge. Each School or college produces additional policies that focus on the special needs and conditions of its constituency.  

Following is a brief outline of the operating instructions for the use of classroom space in the School of Architecture in the context of this course. Each student and member of the faculty is considered to be bound to uphold these standards. Students who repeat a violation after a warning will be asked to vacate their desk and leave the studio or classroom.  

*studio behavior*  

Behavior in studio should be the model of respectful collaboration providing each student and faculty the possibility of a quiet and productive work environment.  Cell phones, pagers, or music are not to be heard in class at all.  Headphones may be used during non-class time hours provided the volume does not disturb those working around you. Outside of class, use the courtyard for more animated conversation or exchange, talking on cell- phones, eating, drinking, or group study. Remember it is each student’s right to have a quiet and respectful studio workspace. Smoking is prohibited on all University of Miami campuses.  

*submission of work* 

All student work should be due no later than the night before the work is due.  

*reviews*  

Reviews are one of the most important learning experiences in the school. Attendance and participation in all assigned reviews are required. Attending the reviews of your peers allows you to see the range of architectural criticism born by different studio topics, sites and the interests and expertise of professors and visiting critics. Attending the reviews of others within your year is often helpful in better understanding your project. Attending the work in other studios broadens your academic experience and helps you prepare for future classes. Student deportment in reviews should model professional standards one finds in practice - dress for should be more formal then everyday attire.  

*student interaction*  

The school and university is a collaborative environment where ideas can be discussed in a respectful and collegial manner. Students shall understand that the school is an academic community that aspires to the highest ethical standards. Differences of opinion should be respected and students should avoid consciously undermining another student’s work or ideas.  

*Peer counselors:* Are selected student representation for each section of first year studio. These students assist in providing guidance for students adjusting to life in the university and professional program.

###Plagiarism and Misconduct - the UM Honor Code:  

The University’s policy on academic misconduct is contained in the University of Miami Honor Code.  

These Codes are established for the student body to protect the academic integrity of the University of Miami, to encourage consistent ethical behavior among students, and to foster a climate of fair competition. While a student's commitment to honesty and personal integrity is assumed and expected, these Codes are intended to provide an added measure of assurance that, in fulfilling the University's requirements, the student will never engage in falsification, plagiarism, or other deception regarding the materials he/she presents. Each student is responsible for completing the academic requirements of each course in the manner indicated by the faculty. Please see the appropriate link below.

###English Language and Writing Support:  

Whether you need help with English language and writing support, students can  be assisted through the Writing Center.  

The Writing Center at the University of Miami offers free, one-on-one assistance with all types of writing concerns.  Located at the University of Miami Learning Commons in Richter Library, the Writing Center can help you at any stage of the writing process, from brainstorming to final revisions.  The Writing Center serves all of the University of Miami community, including students, faculty, and staff.  

The Writing Center is a teaching environment. We will work to teach you ways to improve your writing, but we will not proofread or edit your papers for you. (We will, however, teach you how to proofread and edit your own papers.) Our focus is more on helping you improve as a writer, rather than fixing the paper you bring in.  

For help with your writing projects, schedule a consultation or walk in today.  Appointments last either 25 or 50 minutes.  To get the most from your Writing Center session, please bring the assignment prompt with you, and the paper printed out. You may also want to bring other related materials (previously graded papers, drafts, research, etc.).  

To make an appointment call (305) 284-2956 or [reserve online](http://miami.mywconline.com/).
