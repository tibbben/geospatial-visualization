## Resilience Academy 
### Lesson Plan 

1. Introduction and Housekeeping - 5 min 11:20
   - introduce resilience
   - systems thinking, earth day, image from space, feedback loops, chaos theory
   - stop at definition - have them shout out data for resilience mapping 
   - Design with Nature - Ian McHarg

### stop slides switch to capstone

2. Review of Capstone Project - 30 min 11:50
   - instructions at: https://new.express.adobe.com/webpage/DWPpvMfYwB5k2
   - as a taste of future work options (not a GIS class, not a field method class, etc)
   - either as potential work (directly) or management - think key concepts and terms
   - experimental crowd sourcing/citizen science
   - as policy recommendations (like the guest speaker Stacey Aguilera from Amy Clement)
   - what is resilience .... how do maps fit into this
   - Pieces of the capstone
      - the ArcGIS Online Platform, a great and introductory way to share data, projects, maps, *but* not the only way (ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, etc)
      - phase 1, literature review, check in, how is it going? Any questions? The idea is to find previous work that will inform your project. At the end of phase one your team will establish a focus area and discuss with Michael to refine your capstone project goals.
      - phase 2, data collection, this begins Oct 4 with data modelling, *but* you can start now with a tracing excercise (check in with Michael and Ali), looking around, etc. Luke Norris can also help along with Tim Norris (no relation)
      - phase 3 capstone recommendations as a choose your own adventure (refined at end of phase one). Both individual and team deliverables - you are the consultants giving the recommendation to a government agency, a developer, an ngo, etc.

### resume slides - 5 things and Data Science - the stop

3. Review of Lecture - 10 min 12:00
   - start with questions - 9 of 12 students already had accounts - who has made maps? Who has used GIS in analysis? Who has data visualization experience? Who wants to tell stories? Who wants to learn about leveraging the power of maps? tell some stories perhaps?
   - stories vs analysis - link to the hockey stick graph
   - GIS as data management
   - GIS tools, ArcGIS Online, ArcgGIS Pro, QGIS, Python, others ...
   - too easy to make a bad map, very hard to make a good story
   - getting data is the hardest part (show image on desktop)

### show last slide of resources at library - move downstairs

4. ArcGIS Online Introduction - group work - 60 min 2:25
   - go through login in, getting ArcGIS Pro if they want, issues (is there anyone who cannot login) 5 min
   - have them perform tutorial all the way through creating and sharing the group map - 45 min
   - tutorial prints available, but probably better as pdf on screen (copy and paste stuff)
   - discuss division of labor within groups
   - trace some trees - 10 min

5. Reflect on important lessons learned
   - be careful with sharing and group editing - it is an essential skill to have, but mistakes can happen
   [ - At the end of the class all groups will be deleted, you can request to have the work archived ]
   - Data does not tell stories, humans tell stories with data

6. Everyone together start a brainstorm on what other data they will need - 20 min 2:45
   - Flood zones?? FEMA?? Surge Data?? How to model Sea Level Rise??
   - Finding data is hard, reach out to Hannah and she can direct inquiries to the appropriate people.

7. Relationships between layers - the art of storytelling
   - data modeling reveal for Chris class

8. Next Steps
   - emphasize second tutorial as essential
   - reveal of a bibliography of available data layers in March
