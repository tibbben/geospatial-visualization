   -   Instructors  
   -   Students go around  
   -   Class
      -   overview, very basic cartography class - two sections (1 vs 3 credit)
      -   prepare for further learning or management
      -   telling stories with maps, GIS is a side
      -   reading from Krygier and Wood

2. Syllabus review (2:25 - 2:45 pm - 20 min)  
   -   Computers, Software Data
      -   software setup complete by next class
      -   show box folder
      -   questions about zoom, etc
   -   Learning Objectives:  
      -   get data, munge data, present data
      -   organize data - super important - data curation
      -   tell story with your map
   -   Assignments and Grading:
      -   class participation is important - upper division, safe space  
      -   only one midterm test
      -   written summaries of reading as class participation
      -   readings are very short (not entire chapters)
      -   presentations from Field as part of assignments
      -   presentations practice creating and giving (short)
      -   there will be in class exercises (like today) - screenshots at end to show finished work
      -   what it is, your take, and one external thing related to it
      -   class project, presented during final week with review prior to end of course
      -   class project encouraged to be part of other studio
      -   screenshots and map images from secondary sources are _NOT_ acceptable in final projects
      -   final is considered a short version of the presentation - as a professional sell
   -   Weekly schedule 
      -   review one week and layout
      -   slides all online
      -   class will be mix of lecture, student presentations, exercises together (and maybe time to work)
   -  Time for questions  

3. Break (2:45 - 2:50 pm - 5 min)  

4. Lecture: what is GIS and Cartography (2:50 - 3:20 pm - 30 min)
   -   physical data model - map file vs data files
   -   make sure to emphasize first decisions in project
      -   scale of map, size of map, medium, story, audience (from reading)
   -   is question/story possible - where do you get your data
   -   in data organization, come back to physical data model  

5. Install some software / Break (3:20 - 3:30 pm - 10 min)
   -   test breakout room remote and in person for debugging  

6. Example HW presentations (3:30 - 3:45 pm - 15 min)
      -   what it is, my take, and one external thing related to it  

7. Choose HW pages (3:45 - 4:00 pm - 15 min)
   -   flip through Field and students choose pages
   -   students choose start letter each week
   -   we will scan and place in shared data folder  

8. Break (4:00 - 4:05 pm - 5 min)  

9. Re-create Miami image in ArcGIS Pro (4:05 - 4:45 pm - 40 min)
   -   have everyone use lab machines - screenshot at end
       -   mention onedrive/box solutions to projects
   -   MDC_BuildingSubset.gdb.zip
   -   difficult on a Mac, but possible in QGIS (ask for appointment if interested)
   -   remember
      -   lighting (out of the box is not good)
      -   less than 1 height map (maps are fiction)
      -   adjust elevation (interoperability with data)
      -   export to adobe (GIS as a tool, not the end)
      -   adjust image and add texture
