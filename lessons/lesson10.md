6.   Lecture - More on Joins (3:50 pm - 15 min)
   -   Vector Analysis (one layer and two layer vector operations)
   -   Vector - Raster (extraction and zonal statistics)
   -   Raster - Raster (raster algebra, raster math -- often in raster calculator)
   -   Conversion tools similar to those in photoshop (blends - interpolation) or illustrator (joins - dissolve)
 
7.   Vector Exercise (4:05 pm - 20 min)
   -   count points in polygon - TRIs in census tracts (pushed to next lesson)
   -   buffer and intersect (trees?)
   -   spatial join - add tract IDs to TRI sites (SQL example as well)
   -   extract from raster (elevation from trees)?

8.   Keyword review exercise (4:25 - 20 min)
   -   brainstorm keywords with them on Box file Keywords

9. Self directed exercises? (pushed to next lesson)
   -   something in their project?
   -   Attribute Join Review (3:50 pm - 15 min)
