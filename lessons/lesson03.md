Lesson 3  
========

**Lesson Plan**  

total time 150 minutes. 

1.   Housekeeping (2:00 pm - 10 min)  
   -   Questions on homework, readings, syllabus (note on reading grades on Blackboard)
       -   ArcGIS Business Analyst Tutorial?? No clear expectations ... did anyone finish?
       -   Have GIS built today (from syllabus), no, but we will dedicate time to this later today
   -   Ask about problems with downloading data
   -   Encourage early conversations with Chris or myself about project ideas - start making appointments
   -   Introduce shift to getting data and hands on work (rest of course)
   -   Note about chapter four (week 2) Barney quote ...
   -   Note on meeting appointments ... new booking page for me (microsoft outlook)
   -   ask about Caquard ... who read it? Maps as performances, stories on top of base maps/grids. Originally maps as grids ... now not so much ... maps better than reality - link to first day
       - MacFarlane concludes by arguing that grid maps ‘encourage the elimination of wonder from our relationship with the world. And once wonder has been chased from our thinking about the land, then we are lost’ (Macfarlane, 2007: 145).
       - The main character in the The Map and the Territory, the latest novel by French novelist Michel Houllebecq, argues that ‘The map is more interesting than the territory’ (Houellebecq, 2010: 82). The significance of this idea is slowly developed throughout the novel: the map is more interesting than the territory because it is an idealized simplification of a complex – and often depressing – reality.

2.   Explore project ideas with students (2:10 - 20 min)
   -   Sofia Bond, Alec Rodriguez, Valeria Mendoza, Tomas Hudson

3.   Discuss data modelling based on project ideas (2:30 - 15 min) 

4.   Student Presentations (2:45 - 25 minutes)

5.   Break (3:10 - 5 minutes)

6.   Lecture - Projections (3:15 - 20 minutes)
   -   fools map of the world from late 16th C has cordiform CRS based on ortelius and mercator, was perhaps a statement that we are fools to think we know the world ...
   - https://ncxiao.github.io/map-projections/index.html
   - state plane NAD83: HARN CORS NSRS2007 (2011) - differences in centimeters (approx 30 to less than one)

7.   Demonstration - get data from Miami-Dade, create points, re-project (3:35 - 15 minutes)
   -   look for metadata, spend some time
   -   see if they can find projection, use ... make mistakes
   -   re-project to state plane 
      -   right click layer, look for export
      -   pay attention to projections/CRS (search florida ...)

8.   Demonstration - get data from OSM into QGIS into ArcGIS (3:50 - 15 minutes)
   -   Intro to OSM
   -   Layer filters - a quick way to subset
      -   select all buildings on biscayne
      -   right click layer, look for export only selected
      -   pay attention to projections/CRS (search florida ...)

9.   Break (4:05 - 5 minutes)

10.   Individual work time - get data and put in GIS of choice (4:10 - 30 minutes)

11.   Close / Housekeeping (4:40 - 5 min)
