Lesson 12
========

**Lesson Plan**  

total time 150 minutes. 

1.   Housekeeping (2:00 pm - 10 min)  
   -   Field update
   -   Reading update (remind about late acceptance)
   -   ask about extra credit

2.   Continue SQL exercise
   -   how many people effected by sea level rise

3.   Interpolation
   -   raster to vector -> extraction at points, along lines, or inside polygons (zonal statistics)
   -   vector to raster -> interpolation
   -   see slides from Field (perhaps heat maps slides as well)
      
3.   Student Presentations

4.   Critique of Little River exercise
   -   two main perspectives:
      -   cartographic/GIS/design
      -   resilience and sustainability
   -   go over introduction
      -   critique together
      -   create rubric as we go based on two themes above
   -   break into four groups and critique one section of Risks Challenges and Consequences
      -   Flooding 28-31 (reprint 31-32)
      -   Centering Equity, Extreme Heat 32-35 (reprint 35-36)
      -   Storm water and Drainage, Wastewater Systems 36-39 (reprint) 39-40)
      -   Housing and Green space 40-43 (reprint 43-44)
      -   Transportation 44-45 
   -   look at page 61 - priority projects - critique together 
   -   perhaps look at neighborhood snapshots together
   -   break into same four groups and critique
      -   Housing 87
      -   Storm water and drainage 81
      -   Septic Systems and Sewer 83
      -   Parks and Open Space 85
      -   Transportation 89

   -   data citation?? data sharing??

2.   Extra credit raster exercise
   -   look at HAZUS metadata and how it relates to 5 ft flood zone scenario
   -   look at CDC SVI data
   -   look at US Census resilience data

4.   Continue Vector exercise
   -   spatial join; count TRI sites in Florida census tracts
   -   count pixels in polygons (5ft scenario raster), estimate population affected

5.   Start layout exercise (both QGIS and ArcGIS)
   -   extent indicators on locator map
   -   layout features (location, size)
   -   title, legend, scale
   -   export as svg for illustrator
