1.   Housekeeping (2:00 pm - 10 min)

   -   syllabus updates later in the week, pay attention ...

2.   Check in on ecological resilience (2:10 pm - 15 min)
   -   systems thinking, earth day, image from space, feedback loops, chaos theory
   -   have them list data for resilience mapping -> build into modeling in two weeks

3.   Show examples of resilience mapping (2:25 pm - 10 min)
   -   Design with nature (put on reserve?)
   -   Other examples (maya, blanca, climbs, coral)

4.   Student Presentations (2:35 - 20 min)

5.   Break (2:55 pm - 5 min)

6.   Attribute Join Review (3:00 pm - 15 min)
   -   select, manipulate, save

7.   Lecture - More on Joins (3:15 pm - 15 min)
   -   Vector Analysis (one layer and two layer vector operations)
   -   Vector - Raster (extraction and zonal statistics)
   -   Raster - Raster (raster algebra, raster math -- often in raster calculator)
   -   Conversion tools similar to those in photoshop (blends - interpolation) or illustrator (joins - dissolve)
 
8.   Vector Exercise (3:30 pm - 40 min)
   -   count points in polygon - TRIs in census tracts (pushed to next lesson)
   -   buffer and intersect (trees?)
   -   spatial join - add tract IDs to TRI sites (SQL example as well)
   -   extract from raster (elevation from trees)?

9.   Break (4:10 pm - 5 min)

11.   Keyword review exercise (4:15 - 30 min)
