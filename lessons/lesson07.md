========

**Lesson Plan**  

total time 150 minutes. 

1.   Housekeeping (2:00 pm - 10 min)  
   -   check in on midterm week 8 (one week from today)
   -   remind about projects, data analysis, questions, and stories
   -   syllabus updates later in the week, pay attention ...

2.   Check in on ecological resilience (2:10 pm - 20 min)
   -   systems thinking, earth day, image from space, feedback loops, chaos theory
   -   have them list data for resilience mapping (box file) -> link to modeling from last week
   -   Show examples of resilience mapping: Design with nature (put on reserve?)

3.   Jennifer Posner Visit (2:30 - 60 min)

4.   Break (3:30 pm - 5 min)

5.   Student Field Presentations (3:35 - 15 min) - maybe delay ....

6.   Lecture - More on Joins (3:50 pm - 15 min)
   -   Vector Analysis (one layer and two layer vector operations)
   -   Vector - Raster (extraction and zonal statistics)
   -   Raster - Raster (raster algebra, raster math -- often in raster calculator)
   -   Conversion tools similar to those in photoshop (blends - interpolation) or illustrator (joins - dissolve)
 
7.   Vector Exercise (4:05 pm - 20 min)
   -   count points in polygon - TRIs in census tracts (pushed to next lesson)
   -   buffer and intersect (trees?)
   -   spatial join - add tract IDs to TRI sites (SQL example as well)
   -   extract from raster (elevation from trees)?

8.   Keyword review exercise (4:25 - 20 min)
   -   brainstorm keywords with them on Box file Keywords
   -   Mercator, GIS (three versions), data management, file naming convention, Project File, Data File, Geospatial Data, Raster (common extensions), Vector (common extensions), continuous phenomena, discrete phenomena, Datum, Coordinate Reference System, Spherical, Cartesian, Latitude, Longitude, WGS84, NAD83, UTM, State Plane, Web Mercator, EPSG, classed, non-classed, classification (jenks, quantile, SD, natural breaks), serif, sans serif, geocoding, create x/y, DEM, attribute join, spatial join, legend, scale, north arrow, rasterize, dissolve, extract, map vs GIS, resilience


9. Self directed exercises? (pushed to next lesson)
   -   something in their project?
   -   Attribute Join Review (3:50 pm - 15 min)
       -   select, manipulate, save
   -   HAZUS/FEMA flood zone data and tracts?
   -   supermarkets and census tracts
