### Weekly Schedule:  

All topics/dates/assignments are subject to revision/change based on instructor decisions and any other *force majeur* that may take place during the quarter.  

All assigned reading is to be completed before the class meeting it is listed under. *A short one paragraph written summary of the required readings is to be emailed to [tnorris@miami.edu](mailto:tnorris@miami.edu) and [cmader@med.miami.edu](mailto:cmader@med.miami.edu) before class instruction begins (one email)*. While the optional reading is not required, most of these suggestions are not long reads, and the student's understanding of the material will benefit greatly if time is available.

All assignments listed in the week are due the following week unless otherwise noted.
