*__Week 3:__ Geospatial Data: coordinate reference systems*  
Explore how software and data come together in a custom built GIS. This will include 
putting multiple data layers together in one GIS, symbolizing each data layer appropriately, 
and exploring relationships between layers in the GIS.

>  Learning Objectives:

-   Understand basic principals of map projections and coordinate reference systems
-   Able to describe how raster and vector layers can be symbolized in any GIS
-   Able to perform basic overlay analysis using GIS

>  Practical Objectives:

-   Transform all datasets to one chosen coordinate reference system (CRS), if necessary.
-   Construct a Geographic Information System (GIS) for the final project.

>  Assigned Reading:

-   *Making Maps* (Krygier & Wood, 2016) chapter ...

*__Week 4:__ Cartography: The art and science of making a map*  
Apply basic design principals to making a map. This will include using color theory, the application of figure ground, 
the correct use of fonts, and other cartographic standards to create 

> Learning Objectives:

*__Week 5:__ GIS, Cartography, and Urban Development*  
Explore how maps are woven into political and social contexts of urban development and planning. This will include
an analysis of how maps both represent and construct reality through cartographic performances.
