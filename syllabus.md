###Weekly Schedule:  

All topics/dates/assignments are subject to revision/change based on
instructor decisions and any other *force majeur* that may take place
during the quarter.  

All assigned reading is to be completed before the next class meeting. *A short one paragraph written summary of the required readings is to be emailed to [tnorris@miami.edu](mailto:tnorris@miami.edu) and [cmader@med.miami.edu](mailto:cmader@med.miami.edu) before class instruction begins (one email)*. While the optional reading is not required, most of these suggestions are not long reads, and the student's understanding of the material will benefit greatly if time is available.

*__Pre-Class Preparation:__*  

Before the first class meeting all students will receive an invite for an ESRI ArcGIS online account (if they do not already have one). All students should accept the invitation and log in to ArcGIS online at least one time before the first class meeting.  

Before the first class meeting all students should also complete the following reading assignments.
