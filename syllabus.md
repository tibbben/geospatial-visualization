**Methods of Instruction:**  
Lecture-discussion, demonstration, and practical out-of-class and
in-class assignments. Students are expected to participate in the
lectures, discussions, and in-class projects. We expect that students
have little or no prior GIS/cartography experience/training.

**Evaluation of Student Performance:**  
Students will be assigned a letter grade (A-F) based on the following:

| Evaluated work | percentage / points |  
|:--- |:--- |  
| Homework Assignments | 20% / 50 pts |  
| Class Participation | 10% / 25 pts |  
| Midterm Project | 30% / 75 pts |  
| Final Project | 40% / 100 pts |  
| Total | 100% / 250 pts |  

**Assignments**  
There will be several homework assignments throughout the semester. This
will include reading and writing assignments, online tutorial
assignments, and cartography/GIS assignments.

**Class Participation**  
Engagement in class activities through speaking, contributing comments
to the class web-page, or participating in group projects is an
important aspect of this class

**Midterm Project**  
TBD

**Final Project**  
TBD

**Weekly Schedule:**  
All topics/dates/assignments are subject to revision/change based on
instructor decisions and any other *force majeur* that may take place
during the quarter.
