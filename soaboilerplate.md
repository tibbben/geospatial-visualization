###School of Architecture Culture Policy

*introduction*  

The University of Miami establishes certain policies – some, which have to do with the preservation of academic integrity such as the Honor Code (below), and others, which preserve a climate of freedom from harassment (above) – in order to best support the environment necessary to the pursuit of knowledge. Each School or college produces additional policies that focus on the special needs and conditions of its constituency.  

Following is a brief outline of the operating instructions for the use of classroom space in the School of Architecture in the context of this course. Each student and member of the faculty is considered to be bound to uphold these standards. Students who repeat a violation after a warning will be asked to vacate their desk and leave the studio or classroom.  

*studio behavior*  

Behavior in studio should be the model of respectful collaboration providing each student and faculty the possibility of a quiet and productive work environment.  Cell phones, pagers, or music are not to be heard in class at all.  Headphones may be used during non-class time hours provided the volume does not disturb those working around you. Outside of class, use the courtyard for more animated conversation or exchange, talking on cell- phones, eating, drinking, or group study. Remember it is each student’s right to have a quiet and respectful studio workspace. Smoking is prohibited on all University of Miami campuses.  

*submission of work* 

All student work should be due no later than the night before the work is due.  

*reviews*  

Reviews are one of the most important learning experiences in the school. Attendance and participation in all assigned reviews are required. Attending the reviews of your peers allows you to see the range of architectural criticism born by different studio topics, sites and the interests and expertise of professors and visiting critics. Attending the reviews of others within your year is often helpful in better understanding your project. Attending the work in other studios broadens your academic experience and helps you prepare for future classes. Student deportment in reviews should model professional standards one finds in practice - dress for should be more formal then everyday attire.  

*student interaction*  

The school and university is a collaborative environment where ideas can be discussed in a respectful and collegial manner. Students shall understand that the school is an academic community that aspires to the highest ethical standards. Differences of opinion should be respected and students should avoid consciously undermining another student’s work or ideas.  

*Peer counselors:* Are selected student representation for each section of first year studio. These students assist in providing guidance for students adjusting to life in the university and professional program.

###Plagiarism and Misconduct - the UM Honor Code:  

The University’s policy on academic misconduct is contained in the University of Miami Honor Code.  

These Codes are established for the student body to protect the academic integrity of the University of Miami, to encourage consistent ethical behavior among students, and to foster a climate of fair competition. While a student's commitment to honesty and personal integrity is assumed and expected, these Codes are intended to provide an added measure of assurance that, in fulfilling the University's requirements, the student will never engage in falsification, plagiarism, or other deception regarding the materials he/she presents. Each student is responsible for completing the academic requirements of each course in the manner indicated by the faculty. Please see the appropriate link below.

###English Language and Writing Support:  

Whether you need help with English language and writing support, students can  be assisted through the Writing Center.  

The Writing Center at the University of Miami offers free, one-on-one assistance with all types of writing concerns.  Located at the University of Miami Learning Commons in Richter Library, the Writing Center can help you at any stage of the writing process, from brainstorming to final revisions.  The Writing Center serves all of the University of Miami community, including students, faculty, and staff.  

The Writing Center is a teaching environment. We will work to teach you ways to improve your writing, but we will not proofread or edit your papers for you. (We will, however, teach you how to proofread and edit your own papers.) Our focus is more on helping you improve as a writer, rather than fixing the paper you bring in.  

For help with your writing projects, schedule a consultation or walk in today.  Appointments last either 25 or 50 minutes.  To get the most from your Writing Center session, please bring the assignment prompt with you, and the paper printed out. You may also want to bring other related materials (previously graded papers, drafts, research, etc.).  

To make an appointment call (305) 284-2956 or [reserve online](http://miami.mywconline.com/){:target="\_blank"} .
